# CI: Build WSA with LSPosed + Play Services (non-interactive)
# This workflow applies a small runtime patch to scripts/build.sh to fix an option-parsing bug
# (missing space in `eval set --"$opts"`) that can cause the script to fall back to its interactive
# UI. The patch is applied only in the runner and does not modify the repository.
