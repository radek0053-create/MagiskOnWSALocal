# CI: Build WSA with LSPosed + Play Services (non-interactive)
# Notes:
# - Use non-interactive build.sh (avoids run.sh interactive dialogs).
# - Ask build.sh to compress output as zip (--compress-format zip) so CI can upload it directly.
# - If build produces no outputs we add a small README so artifact is always produced.
# - Cache pip, install needed system deps (zip already included).
